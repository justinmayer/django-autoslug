django-autoslug
===============

Django-autoslug is a reusable Django application that provides an improved
slug field which can automatically:

a) populate itself from another field,
b) preserve uniqueness of the value and
c) use custom `slugify()` functions for better i18n.

Examples
--------

A simple example::

    from django.db.models import CharField, Model
    from autoslug import AutoSlugField

    class Article(Model):
        title = CharField(max_length=200)
        slug = AutoSlugField(populate_from='title')

More complex example::

    from django.db.models import CharField, DateField, ForeignKey, Model
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    from autoslug import AutoSlugField

    class Article(Model):
        title = CharField(max_length=200)
        pub_date = DateField(auto_now_add=True)
        author = ForeignKey(User)
        slug = AutoSlugField(populate_from=lambda instance: instance.title,
                             unique_with=['author__name', 'pub_date__month'],
                             slugify=lambda value: value.replace(' ','-'))
